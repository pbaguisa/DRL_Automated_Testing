# DRL Automated Testing

## Overview
This project explores the automation of **application testing** using **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL).** AI agents were trained using two algorithms—**PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)** and **A2C (Advantage Actor-Critic)**—within a custom environment called the **Bubble Game.**
